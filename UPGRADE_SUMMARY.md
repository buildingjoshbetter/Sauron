git push

# 2. On Pi: pull and install service
ssh pi@192.168.4.62

## What SAURON Can Do Now

### Remembers Everything
```
Week 1: "I'm building a drone with 3D-printed frame"
Week 5: "What material did I use for my drone?"
SAURON: "3D-printed. You were considering carbon fiber later."
```

### Manages Its Own Storage
- Runs at 3 AM daily
- Summarizes yesterday's transcripts + images
- Deletes old raw files
- Keeps summaries forever
- No manual cleanup needed

### Starts on Boot
- Pi reboots → SAURON starts automatically
- Crashes → restarts in 10 seconds
- No SSH needed

### Understands You
- Knows your personality
- Matches your energy
- Pushes back when needed
- Sparring partner, not servant

## Useful Commands

```bash
# Check status
sudo systemctl status sauron

# View logs
tail -f /home/pi/sauron_data/logs/sauron.log

# Restart after code update
sudo systemctl restart sauron

# View summaries
ls /home/pi/sauron_data/daily_summaries/
cat /home/pi/sauron_data/daily_summaries/transcripts_2025-10-09.json | jq '.summary'

# Check storage
du -sh /home/pi/sauron_data/*
```

## What Happens at 3 AM

1. Summarize yesterday's transcripts → `daily_summaries/transcripts_YYYY-MM-DD.json`
2. Summarize yesterday's images → `daily_summaries/images_YYYY-MM-DD.json`
3. Delete audio files >24h old
4. Delete image files >24h old
5. Keep summaries forever (text only)

## Result

✅ **64 GB SD card lasts indefinitely**  
✅ **Full history preserved as summaries**  
✅ **Photographic memory** (recalls anything ever mentioned)  
✅ **Fully autonomous** (starts on boot, manages itself)  
✅ **Knows Josh deeply** (personality, preferences, patterns)

**SAURON is now production-ready.** Deploy and forget.
